# AI-Based Online Exam Proctoring System

## Overview

The **AI-Based Online Exam Proctoring System** is a cutting-edge proctoring solution that ensures the integrity of online examinations. It employs advanced artificial intelligence techniques, including face detection, object detection, gaze tracking, real-time browser activity monitoring, and audio analysis, to monitor and prevent fraudulent activities during exams. This system helps maintain fairness and credibility in remote examinations by providing automated invigilation and detailed reports.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Identifies and verifies the student's face to ensure the registered candidate is taking the exam.
- **Object Detection**: Detects unauthorized objects such as smartphones, books, or other cheating materials.
- **Gaze Detection**: Monitors the candidate's eye movements to detect suspicious behavior, such as looking away from the screen frequently.
- **Real-Time Browser Activity Monitoring**: Tracks tab switches and alerts when the candidate navigates away from the exam interface.
- **Audio Analysis**: Captures and analyzes external sounds through an external microphone to detect conversations or background noises.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed reports on suspicious activities and rule violations for invigilators to review.
- **User Authentication**: Face matching and email/password authentication required only during student registration and login.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: A well-designed homepage with a modern layout, login and register buttons, and important notices.
- **No Offline Mode Support**: The system explicitly notifies users that offline mode is not supported to prevent exam manipulation.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5.1.5 (Python-based web framework)
- **Database**: PostgressSQL(for efficient data storage and retrieval)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with UI/UX inspired by provided images)
- **AI Models**: OpenCV, MediaPipe (for face and object detection), custom ML models
- **Authentication**: Django authentication system with face-matching capabilities
- **Deployment**: Hosted on a cloud platform with scalability in mind
